# Sorting Visualization Program

This program implements several sorting algorithms and visualizes their execution using Matplotlib. The user can select a sorting algorithm and see a step-by-step visualization of how the algorithm sorts the input list.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented

1. Radix Sort
2. Bubble Sort
3. Quick Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Shell Sort
6. Selection Sort
7. Insertion Sort
8. Binary Insertion Sort
9. Heap Sort

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Choose a sorting algorithm by entering the corresponding number.
3. View the visualization of the sorting process.
4. After the sorting is complete, the program will ask if you want to visualize another sorting algorithm.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib

## Code Structure

- `BubbleSort`: Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm and visualizes the sorting process.
- `InsertionSort`: Implements the Insertion Sort algorithm and visualizes the sorting process.
- `SelectionSort`: Implements the Selection Sort algorithm and visualizes the sorting process.
- `ShellSort`: Implements the Shell Sort algorithm and visualizes the sorting process.
- `MergeSort`: Implements the Merge Sort algorithm and visualizes the sorting process.
- `QuickSort`: Implements the Quick Sort algorithm and visualizes the sorting process.
- `RadixSort`: Implements the Radix Sort algorithm and visualizes the sorting process.
- `BinaryInsertSort`: Implements the Binary Insertion Sort algorithm and visualizes the sorting process.
- `HeapSort`: Implements the Heap Sort algorithm and visualizes the sorting process.

## Visualization

The program uses Matplotlib to visualize the sorting process. Each bar represents an element in the list, and the height of the bar represents the value of the element. The bars move and change color as the sorting algorithm progresses, providing a visual representation of the sorting process.
